# SeedListReset
Macro that resets through a list of seeds
## Usage
In the same directory as `SeedListReset.ahk` you'll need to have a file named `i.txt` inside it put just the number 1

When starting the macro input the text file with all the seeds (they should be only separated by newlines and nothing else)
